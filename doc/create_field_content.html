<h2>How to create your own fields</h2>

<p>Once you've grasped the main ideas behind inputEx, you'll probably want to create your own fields. Here are some hints  on how to do so :</p>

	
<div>
	<p><b>Choose the right parent Class !</b></p>
	
	<p>look at the classes to pick the closest one<br />
		 if there's none, you schould inherit from inputEx.Field</p>
</div>
	


<div>
	<p><b>Override methods</b></p>

	<p>setOptions
	- function to override options	
	render :
	- this is basically the rendering of your component
	renderComponent
	</p>
</div>


	
<div>
	<p><b>updatedEvt</b></p>
	
	<p>- fire this event to indicate modifications with this.fireUpdatedEvt();</p>
</div>
	
	
<div>
	<p><b>Code conventions</b></p>
	
	<p>- use YAHOO.extend to extend classes
	- cannot use the third argument of YAHOO.extend to override/add methods because of JSDoc</p>
	
</div>
